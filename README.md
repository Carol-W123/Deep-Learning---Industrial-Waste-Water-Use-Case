# Deep-Learning---Waste-Water-Use-Case

# The aim of this project is to more efficiently manage and release wastewater to mitigate increase the river water quality. The business value of this project falls into three buckets:
1.	Improve on operating parameters to identify risk areas and enhance decision making.
2.	Improve environmental performance by optimizing freshwater draw & water feed to tailing ponds by increasing wastewater reuse, recycle, and release.
3.	Reduce tailings containment load & associated liabilities by exploring opportunities to expand water release routes and reduce water feed to tailings ponds.

# Data Ingestion:
The lab quality, water abnormal events, and historical process data are ingested (>300 columns, 1M rows)
# Machine Learning:
Anomoly detection using Birch clustering and agglomerative clustering
Multivariate recurrent neural network was developed to predict futurevalues of each variable. 
Abnormal event is predicted with various machine learning methods
