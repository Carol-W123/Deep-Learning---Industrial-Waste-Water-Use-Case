# Deep-Learning---Industrial-Waste-Water-Use-Case
This is one of the real world use case I have worked on by applying my data science and machine learning knowledge.  

# The aim of this project is to more efficiently manage and release upgrading wastewater to mitigate the constraints on fluid containment. The business value of this project falls into three buckets:
1.	Improve on operational excellence by equipping operators, engineers, and environmental advisors with a continuously learning model to identify risk areas and enhance decision making.
2.	Improve environmental performance by optimizing freshwater draw & water feed to tailing ponds by increasing wastewater reuse, recycle, and release.
3.	Reduce tailings containment load & associated liabilities by exploring opportunities to expand water release routes and reduce water feed to tailings ponds.

# Data Ingestion:
The lab quality, toxicity, and PI historical data are ingested (>300 columns, 100M rows)
# Machine Learning:
Anomoly detection using Birch clustering and agglomerative clustering
Multivariate recurrent neural network was developed to predict futurevalues of each variable. 
Toxicity event is predicted with various machine learning methods
